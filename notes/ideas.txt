0-200 retrieved 9/10
done - also get a big list of IDs today so can redo 200+
done - get 0-100 also

done redo 200-500 (done 400-500)
done check no duplicates

done - designers
games network (interrelationships of titles)
done - mechanisms - which are most recognisable
done - correlations between terms
done - correlations between games with similar terms 
done - correlations between user ratings and particular terms
done - clustering
done - 'fingerprint'
done - ands an ors of high values with particular terms

done - relative ratio? take raw number into account?

1. Intro 

- pulling the data
- analyse_comments (titles, designers, mechanics, dynamics, themes)
- like_designer

2. Plots

- plot_series
- comparison_plot
- scatter_plot
(filler/gateway/heavy euro), (complex/deep/heavy)

3. Fingerprint (basic)

- defining a 'good gene' (correlation with others, distribution, confounders, meaning)
- build_df
- querying for combinations
- correlation matrix between terms (and scatterplots)

4. Fingerprint (advanced)

- find_cluster (kmeans + hierarchical)
- find_similarity

4. User data

- user_corrs
- fit_model

5. Next steps

- force-directed graph
- better prediction model
